      "321,Anxious,\"Anxiety whispers today. Some days, existing feels like an exhausting marathon. Small victories matter. Today, I managed to set a boundary at work that I've been struggling with for months. I'm proud of myself for recognizing when I need to step back and rest. Self-care isn't selfish, it's necessary. My mental health is not linear. Some days are bright, some are cloudy, and that's okay. Imposter syndrome is real. Despite my achievements, I constantly doubt my capabilities. Friendship isn't about constant contact, but about the quality of connection when you do connect.\"\n",
